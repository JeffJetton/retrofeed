# RetroFeed

Use a Raspberry Pi to display weather, news, and other information, on a composite monitor... vintage style!

See config.md for tips on seting up your Pi for composite output, getting it to boot to the command line, configuring the terminal to look correctly "retro", etc.

Currently this is just clumsily web-scraping the information displayed, and periodically refreshing the underlying data at certain intervals. Expect the scrapers to break at some point. One could also use RSS feeds and/or publically-available APIs, of course.
